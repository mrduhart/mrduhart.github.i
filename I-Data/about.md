I know. We already have lots of data science blogs out there. Some work with and some. Some others are , while there are cases of .

So, why would we need yet another blog on this topic? To be honest with you: we don't.

The true reason I decided to start this project was to have a professional portfolio that I could show to future employeers and clients. Ohhhh, yeahhh. As it sounds. I am writing this only to show myself and my talents (wait, was I supposed to actually write that?).

But in reality, I'm not. I'm doing it for a couple more of reasons. But first, let me tell you a bit about myself.

Once upon a time, I became a robotics engineer. Oh, man, I really love robotics, should you know. At that time, the intelligence part of the trade was one of the topics that most interested me. Of course we were also taught the mechanics and electronics stuff, but it was in the programming and control of the robots that I found more success.

Later, I went into a master in computer science. There, our research group (and courses) were focused towards machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science and basically any other stuff needed to conquer the world with machines. But at some point, that ended as well (I mean, the master's, not jugdgement day).

Now, I'm unemployed, sleep in my parents basement, wear the same clothes everyday, and eat what I find where I find it. Yep. True story. So, I decided that starting a blog about data and AI was the best thing to do.

Well, maybe I was exaggerating a little about my conditions up there, but it is true that this blog was born after I finished studying my master's, and then I realized three things. First, that I did not actually have anything to show potential employeers and clients what I can do (yes, that part was absolutely true). Second, that I enjoy writing a lot (not my thesis, I used dictation for that). But also, that even with all the existing blogs and courses out there, we can still improve on them.

If you have ever taken an online course, you may know it can become too college-ish and then you get lost in the middle of the road, without finishing. Books are also great, but let's be honest, hardly anyone has the time to ever go through the whole material. And then, we have blogs. These can be great, but hey, the [math and fancy degree](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-if-i-dont-have-a-degree/) truly are necessary (the fancy degree not that much). It's just that they're NOT OBLIGATORY to understand and apply the fields of machine learning and data science.

To conclude, what does this blog have to offer then? Well, here you will find love, happiness and anything you've ever dreamed of... Ok, no. It's not that kind of blog.

My intention is to present you with simple and intuitive explanations of concepts, without leaving the math behind, but not forcing it down your throats either. Then, after we've gone through the "theory" for the work and have the foundations, I will also show you how to do cool things with real datasets.

Come and join me on the road to become a data master. Please, enjoy.
